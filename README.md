# Introduction
Currently, there are many methods for calculating students’ multiple-choice test scores. However, grading exams for hundreds or even thousands of students accurately and efficiently remains a significant challenge. This difficulty is further compounded when student responses do not strictly follow the standard format, such as having extra answers, missing answers, or leaving questions blank.

# Solution 

To address this problem, I developed a Python program called **Test Grade Calculator**, applying **data processing techniques learned at the Université de Strasbourg ( technique de programmation I )** along with additional knowledge from **external resources**.

# Objective 
In this mini-project, the objective is to design a program capable of calculating test scores for multiple classes with a large number of students.
The primary goal of the program is to reduce grading time while ensuring accuracy and consistency in the evaluation process.

# Project Structure

To achieve this, the program utilizes various Python functionalities to perform the following tasks:

- Open and read required external text files using **exception handling** to ensure robust error management.

- Scan each line of exam answers to identify valid and invalid data, then generate a corresponding data validation report.

- Grade each exam according to the predefined grading rubric and output the results.

- Generate and save the final results in a properly named output file.
